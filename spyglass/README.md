# Spyglass
A spyglass is a lensed monocular maritime instrument used to see things that may have been
difficult to see otherwise.

Spyglass is a pluggable artifact viewer framework for [Prow](..) and a crude
metaphor for the real object. It collects artifacts (usually files in a storage
bucket) from various sources and distributes them to registered viewers, which
are responsible for consuming them and rendering a view.

A typical Spyglass page might look something like this:
![I'm not a graphic designer I just make the backend](spyglass-example.png)

A general Spyglass query will proceed as follows:
- User provides a job source in the query (usually a job name and build ID).
- Spyglass finds all artifact names associated with the given job source.
- Spyglass builds a cache of which artifacts match which lenses via
  configured regular expressions.
- Lenses with matching artifacts are pre-rendered in order of descending
  priority.
- Spyglass then sends render requests to each registered lens with its
  matching artifacts.
- Each lens performs any necessary operations on the artifacts and produces
  a blob of HTML.
- Views (HTML) are inserted asynchronously as viewers return.

# Available views

Spyglass currently exposes the following views:

* `/job-history/<gcs-bucket-name>/pr-logs/directory/<job-name>` to get the history of a job
* `/pr-history?org=<org>&repo=<repo>&pr=<pr number>` to get the history of a PR
* `/view/gcs/<gcs-bucket-name>/pr-logs/pull/<repo-name>/<pull-number>/<job-name>/<build-id>` to get the job result after it finished
* `/view/prowjob/<job-name>/<build-id>` to check on the running job, this only works as long as the pod that runs the job still exists


## Lenses
A lens is an set of functions that consume a list of artifacts and produces some
HTML.

Lens names are unique, and must much the package name for the lens.


### Built-in Viewers
Spyglass comes with some built-in viewers for commonly produced artifacts.

- Prow Metadata
  ```
  Name: metadata
  Title: Metadata
  Match: finished.json|started.json
  Priority: 0
  ```
- JUnit
  ```
  Name: junit
  Title: JUnit
  Matches: artifacts/junit.*\.xml
  Priority: 5
  ```
- Logs
  ```
  Name: buildlog
  Title: Build Log
  Matches: build-log.txt|pod-log
  Priority: 10
  ```

### Building your own viewer
Building a viewer consists of three main steps.

#### Write Boilerplate
First, create a package `lensnamehere` under `prow/spyglass/lenses` and
import the `lenses` package.

#### Implement
Next, implement the necessary functions for a viewer. More specifically,
implement the following interface (defined in lenses.go):
```go
type Lens interface {
	// Config returns the name, title, priority, and other information about your lens.
	Config() LensConfig
	// Header is used to inject content into the lens's <head>. It will only ever be called once per load.
	Header(artifacts []Artifact, resourceDir string) string
	// Body is used to generate the contents of the lens's <body>. It will initially be called with empty data, but
	// the lens front-end code may choose to re-render itself with custom data.
	Body(artifacts []Artifact, resourceDir string, data string) string
	// Callback is used for the viewer to exchange arbitrary data with the frontend. It is called with lens-specified
	// data, and returns data to be passed to the lens. JSON encoding is recommended in both directions.
	Callback(artifacts []Artifact, resourceDir string, data string) string
}
```

In the `init` method, call `lenses.RegisterLens()` with an instance of your implementation of the interface.
Spyglass should now be aware of your lens.

Additionally, some front-end TypeScript code can be provided. Configure your BUILD.bazel to build it, then emit a
\<script> tag with a relative reference to it in your `Header()` implementation. See `buildlog/BUILD.bazel` for an
example.

In your typescript code, a global `spyglass` object will be available, providing the following interface:

```ts
export interface Spyglass {
  /**
   * Replaces the lens display with a new server-rendered page.
   * The returned promise will be resolved once the page has been updated.
   */
  updatePage(data: string): Promise<void>;
  /**
   * Requests that the server re-render the lens with the provided data, and
   * returns a promise that will resolve with that HTML as a string.
   *
   * This is equivalent to updatePage(), except that the displayed content is
   * not automatically changed.
   */
  requestPage(data: string): Promise<string>;
  /**
   * Sends a request to the server-side lens backend with the provided data, and
   * returns a promise that will resolve with the response as a string.
   */
  request(data: string): Promise<string>;
  /**
   * Inform Spyglass that the lens content has updated. This should be called whenever
   * the visible content changes, so Spyglass can ensure that all content is visible.
   */
  contentUpdated(): void;
}
```

#### Add to config
Finally, decide which artifacts you want your viewer to consume and create a regex that
matches these artifacts. The JUnit viewer, for example, consumes all
artifacts that match `artifacts/junit.*\.xml`.

Add a line in `prow` config under the `viewers` section of `spyglass` of the following form:
```yaml
"myartifactregexp": ["my-view-name"]
```

The next time a job is viewed that contains artifacts matched by your regexp,
your view should display.

See the [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/k8s.io/test-infra/prow/spyglass/lenses) for
more details and examples.

## Config

Spyglass is currently disabled by default. To enable it, add the `--spyglass` arg to your
[deck deployment](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/e9e544733854d54403aa1dfd84ca009fd9b942f0/prow/cluster/starter.yaml#L236).

Note: if the log files aren't publicly accessible from within GCS, `--gcs-credentials-file` arg must be passed to deck deployment as well to be able to surf the logs in spyglass. By doing this, spyglass will display the build logs from GCS to anyone who is authorized to access spyglass.


To provide any use, Spyglass must by configured. Its config takes the following form:
```yaml
deck:
  spyglass:
    size_limit: 500e+6 # 500MB
    viewers:
      "started.json|finished.json": ["metadata"]
      "build-log.txt": ["buildlog"]
      "artifacts/junit.*\\.xml": ["junit"] # Remember to escape your '\' in yaml strings!
```

More formally, it is a single `spyglass` object under the top-level `deck`
object that may contain fields `viewers` and `size_limit`. `viewers` is a map of `string->[]string`
where the key must be a [valid golang regular
expression](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) and the value is a list
of viewer names that consume the artifacts matched by the corresponding regular
expression. `size_limit` is the maximum artifact size `spyglass` will try to
read in entirety before failing.
